      <div class="header-paragraph">
        We are collectively run by Christopher F. Costa, Katharine Chin, and
        Tori Ernst, who share administrative duties equally. In lieu of a single
        artistic director, we call our three-headed-leadership team The Coven.
        Why Coven? Although the moniker began as a wry placeholder, we’ve come
        to embrace the title wholeheartedly. “Coven” conjures an image of a
        trusted trio who, with their combined powers, create something out of
        nothing—magic. Not unlike the magic of creating a play or film. In a
        coven, as in a collective, the whole is greater than the sum of its
        parts. A coven also represents an alternative power structure to
        traditional, hierarchical structures. We are drawn to and committed to a
        different way to lead.

              Festival 2022, Short Film Corner. Tori is passionate about telling
