            making theatre or movies, you'll find her knitting, listening to
            audiobooks, and goofing off with her husband and two daughters.

            <span class="name">Tori Ernst </span> is an actor, producer and
            writer based in NYC. She grew up in Harrisburg PA, fly fishing with
            her dad on weekends and religiously listening to the entire David
            Bowie discography with my mom. She's half Greek and finds her Greek
            heritage has informed how she tells stories (lots of arm gestures
            and drama). Tori moved to NYC to attend Marymount Manhattan College
            where she earned her BFA. After graduation, Tori worked in off-off
            broadway theater for a few years. In 2012, she was a part of
            Theatermakers at the Eugene O’Neill Center NTI, where she discovered
            that I feel most inspired developing new works. Tori craves the
            collaborative process between actor, writer and director. In 2019
            she graduated from The New School of Drama with my MFA in Acting
            where originated several roles including “Pearl” in Pony Up by
            Mallory Jane Weiss and “Andie” in The Tall Ones by Miles Orduña. In
            2020, Tori wrote, produced and starred-in a short film called
            Counting, which centers on the life of a young woman struggling with
            severe OCD, based on Tori's own experience with OCD. The film went
            on to win several awards, was re-scored by Sony Music and was
            featured at the Cannes Film Festival 2022, Short Film Corner. Tori
            is passionate about telling complicated stories with curiosity and
            empathy. www.toriernst.com
