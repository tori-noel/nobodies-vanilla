      <h1>about us</h1>
      <p>
        We are the nobodies collective. We are a collective dedicated to
        building artistic community and nurturing new works.<br />
        <br />
        Each month, we gather to develop new work. Any type of new work that
        requires collaboration with others for the work to progress.<br />
        <br />
        While traditionally this has meant gathering around a new play or
        screenplay draft (i.e. writers and directors spearheading projects), we
        want actors and other interpretive artists (i.e. folks who don’t
        identify as writers, directors) to remember that you have creative
        agency here. <br />
        <br />If a project will help your process, it’s right for Lab.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />

      <h3>mission statement</h3>
      <p>A few fundamental values that run through everything we do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          we aim to cultivate a brave space for creative exploration. midwifing
          stories involves risk. stories worth telling often venture into topics
          that are emotionally dangerous, uncomfortable, difficult; we believe
          it’s possible to bravely explore difficult content while caring for
          and respecting the artist’s well-being.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          we believe in the transformative power of community building; we
          believe being in community is vital to our survival as artists.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          leading with transparency: we believe that cultivating and equitable
          space is incomplete without transparency from those who hold power;
          the coven’s metaphorical door is always open. If you have concerns or
          hopes or dreams about how you want to cast/write/produce/direct, you
          can come to us.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          joining us: we encourage members to give (time, talent, writing,
          projects, etc.) as they can, understanding that the life of a working
          artist is emotionally, energetically, financially, logistically
          demanding. come when you can, leave gently when you can’t. it’s hard
          out there. we strive to create a warm home where you can rest your
          weary feet. there’s room to stay, there’s grace to leave.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
